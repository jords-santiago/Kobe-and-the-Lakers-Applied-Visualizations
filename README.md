# Kobe-and-the-Lakers-Applied-Visualizations
Kobe True Shooting Percentage vs. Lakers' Team Record Visualization using Python Jupyter Notebooks

This is the project that I submitted in one of the courses of the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization in Coursera.

This visualization is with regards to the region Los Angeles, California, United States with category Sports and Athletics.

This project is trying to determine:

How has the win percentage of the Los Angeles Lakers change along with the performance (true shooting percentage) of Kobe Bryant throughout his 20 years with the Lakers?

The datasets are found in:

For Lakers record: Team_Records.csv from https://www.kaggle.com/boonpalipatana/nba-season-records-from-every-year

For Kobe Bryant's statistics: all_seasons.csv from https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/nba-players-data
